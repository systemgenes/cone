The most flexible and beginner's C libraries and helper functions

This project aims to provide library and helper functions for C projects. The goal is to keep the code flexible and easy to modify and integrate. 
Currently, I dont plan to accept contributions, at least not before pushing significant line of codes. Lets hope this works out well and can be used widely.
